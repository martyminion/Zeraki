1. Given an array K with N integers from 1 to N+1 such that the array has exactly one integer missing, write

e.g. given K = [3,5,4,1], the function should return 2

    i. run the array.py file 
        "python3.8 array.py"
    ii. User is given chance to enter the specified values as per the constraints of the array given, i.e. 1, N+1
    iii. The program returns the missing value
